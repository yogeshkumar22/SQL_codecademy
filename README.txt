World Populations SQL Practice

Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
You’ll work with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. You’ll write queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions.

Setup Instructions
If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by opening the link below. If you need help setting up your computer, be sure to check out our SQLite setup guide. You can then run SQL commands from your terminal, or install DB Browser to run SQL commands from a desktop application. Our article on running SQL commands in DB Browser will walk you through opening a database file and running queries.
